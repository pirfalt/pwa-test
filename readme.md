## Running

### Prerequisite

```sh
# Dependencies
npm install
```

```sh
# Only required for testing the production build locally
npm install -g serve
```

### Start

```sh
# Dev environment
npm run dev
```

```sh
# Build prod
npm run build

# Test prod locally
serve -l 8000 docs
```

### Deploy

Since we are using gh-pages, every push is a deployment. However only the `/docs` folder is served. Therefor a production build is required before the push.

```sh
npm run build
git add docs
git commit -m "Deploy production build"
git push
```

## Live site

## Gotchas

> Turns out that when you call `navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js)` the request for `service-worker.js` _isn't_ intercepted by any service worker's `fetch` event handler.

Since _that_ request is not handled by the service worker the service worker itself is always requested from the server. Which leads to at least one request to the server _every_ time, completely negating the offline capability ðŸ˜­.

However _that_ special request _does_ respect the http caching headers. So that "completely negating the offline capability" is not actually true ðŸ˜…. But rather, offline capability only works for as long as the service worker does not need to be re-fetched. Meaning at most until the cache time expires or the file is evicted by the browser.

## TODO

- [x] Introduction and background.
- [x] Watch [100 second youtube introduction](https://youtu.be/sFsRylCQblw?list=PLLHiuVbsSGYrq8kP6lNV5BXOYfe3PBCCO).
- [x] Offline support.
  - [x] Basic cache strategies.
    - Cache only.
    - Cache first, refresh in background.
    - Server first, with refresh, fallback to cache.
- [x] Manifest.
